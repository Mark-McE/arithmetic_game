Game to teach young children arithmetic:

This is an interactive game that teaches 5 to 7 year olds how to add,
subtract, multiply and divide positive integers.

The game supports tailored learning by dynamically adapting its questions
according to the child’s ability to learn as follows:
• If the child answers three consecutive questions correctly, the game
  moves up a level and starts monitoring the child’s answers afresh.
  If the game is already at the highest level, the level remains unchanged.

• If the child answers three consecutive questions incorrectly the game
  moves down a level and starts monitoring the child’s answers afresh.
  If the game is already at lowest level, the level remains unchanged.

The game has seven levels of difficulty, each higher level allows for a
wider range of integers to be used. The lowest level uses the integer
range 1- 4; the next 1- 5; then 1-6, 1-7, 1-8 and so on until 1-10.

Example questions include:

• What is 1 + 4?

• What is 5 * 2?

• What is 8 / 2?
